# [LandWorks] Metaverse Report Bounty

## Overview

The following document outlines the requirements and expected delivery for producing a report on one or multiple metaverses.
LandWorks is a protocol for renting/lending digital land. In its MVP version, it will support only Decentraland, however, we would like to do a feasibility check on the rest of the Metaverses and verify if any "low-hanging" fruits can be integrated as well.
The purpose of the report is for the Core team to assess and potentially integrate as many metaverses as possible in a short period. The best way to do that would be to tap into the creativity and knowledge of the DAO community ðŸš€

## Requirements

For the successful completion of this Bounty, a report on a metaverse must be provided. The following information must be provided:

- General Description / Overview of the metaverse
- Whether the metaverse has a native Marketplace and whether it provides renting/lending natively
- Where is the metaverse based? (Is it deployed on an EVM network/Rollup or other? Ethereum/Polygon/Side-chain etc)
- Addresses + source code of important contracts (ERC20/721/Marketplace/Registry etc.)
- Is Land scarce in the metaverse or anyone can mint new properties?
  - Whether the metaverse has a concept of "operators". Is there a way for the "owner" of Land to authorise other addresses to publish scenes?
- How do scene publishing works? Is it authenticated (f.e metaverse servers/nodes are requesting signed messages from the owner/operator)?
- **Bonus**
  - Provide your thoughts on how important it is to integrate with the specified metaverse (reason for important does not include "you have land there, and you want to rent it out through LandWorks").
  - Provide your thoughts on how hard it would be to integrate with the Metaverse? Assume that LandWorks protocol will become the owner of deposited land and renters must be able to use it (deploy scenes)
  - Propose a design for Integrating

Providing the described information will allow us to:
- Have a feasibility report on the Metaverse
- Asses the effort required and prioritise its integration
- Best case scenario would be the integration of the Metaverse as part of LandWorks Version 1 release

## Other

The following metaverses are yet to be researched:

- Dvision Network - $DVI - _in progress by @kibura_
- Netvrk
- VictoriaVRy
- Wilder World
- OVR

Depending on the findings in the report, follow-up work can be initiated for integrating one or more metaverses into LandWorks.

**Bounty**:

- 600 ENTR **per** Metaverse
- 900 ENTR total **per** Metaverse with Bonus section completed

(**Example**: IF both CryptoVoxels and Sandbox are fully completed with the Bonus requirements, then you'll get 1800 ENTR)

## Updates

Reports for the following metaverses have been submitted:
