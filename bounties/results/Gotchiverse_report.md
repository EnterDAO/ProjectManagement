## Overview & Aavegotchi basics

This metaverse, a.k.a The Gotchiverse Realm, is basically a MMORPG with DeFi elements. 
DeFi comes into play right off the bat - to summon an Aavegotchi, the player needs to stake his new fren with yield generating aTokens (tokens from the Aave protocol, which in turn become the Aavegotchi's **Spirit Force**).

Our digital frens are summoned from a standalone NFT - a Portal. So far, there have been two Portal drops ("Haaunts") since March 2021. Portal trading is alive and well with closed Portals steadily rising in value in the Baazaar (in-game marketplace).
After opening a Portal, players choose from 10 Gotchis, whose traits are randomly generated by Chainlink VRF. These traits determine the Gotchi's appearance and rarity.

The Aavegotchi itself is an ERC-721 NFT that can own / manage child NFTs (ERC-1155 NFT Wearables).  
These wearables alter the Gotchi's appearance and rarity, which is an important concept in one of the game mechanics - rarity farming. 


#### Basic game mechanics & concepts
As we mentioned, every Gotchi has **specific traits that can be altered** - not only via wearables, but also via earning XP, levelling up and distributing points (RPG style).
XP is earned by the Gotchi owners attending special events on Discord, voting for DAO proposals and by taking part in occasional minigame competitions. 

**Minigames** are not only fun, but an also educational aspect of the Aavegotchi world, since many of them have been created by the community. 
The ecosystem and tooling allows for low-friction development using Aavegotchi assets and data, and contribution is encouraged.

Players are also motivated to take care of their Gotchis via a metric called **Kinship**, which rises and falls based on daily interactions with the Gotchi (or lack thereof).
High Kinship helps with rarity farming and is also going to have benefits in the upcoming Gotchiverse gameplay.    

All of the above mentioned concepts play a significant part in **rarity farming** events, during which Gotchis are monetarily rewarded for their rarity, kinship and XP score.  
Amounts of **the native ERC-20 token, GHST**, are deposited into the Aavegotchi's pocket (its own escrow contract) based on the Gotchi's position on the rarity farming leaderboard.
Special commemorative badges are distributed this way as well, which cannot be sold - they document the Gotchi's unique on-chain history.  

The DeFi aspect doesn't end with the Spirit Force, however. Players are motivated to **stake GHST** in-game and **provide liquidity** on QuickSwap and DinoSwap. 
Apart from receiving standard LP rewards on the exchange, the game itself rewards players with **FRENS** (not a token, just in-game points), which can be used to purchase **Raffle tickets**.
This is also a good low-risk way of earning actual GHST (not only) for newcomers, since raffle tickets are standalone NFTs tradable in the Baazaar.     

**The Baazaar** is the **in-game marketplace**, where all the assets can be freely traded (Portals - open & closed, Aavegotchis, Wearables, Land, XP & Kinship Potions and Rafle tickets)

**Raffle events** themselves are an opportunity to win in-game assets. There has been the occasional single-ticket-purchasing-godlike-rarity-wearable-winner .. things happen :) ..   

Another way to obtain assets is a GBM(TM) auction, dubbed **Bid to Earn Auction**, which is a special type of NFT auction allowing the outbid party to earn a percentage on top of their original bid.
This way even "losers" walk away with more GHST than they started with. This type of auction was already successfully used to distribute Wearables, Haaunt 2 Portals and a portion of the Gotchiverse Land Parcels. 


### The Gotchiverse basics - getting to the point :)
This is the part you all came here for, so let's get down to it... 

The Gotchiverse consists of The Citaadel (a walled-off area), The Grid (basically the wilderness outside the city walls) and The Beyond (a far-away unknown area of the Gotchiverse).

There is a total supply of 420069 REALM parcels (ERC721 NFTs) that represent ownership of plots of land. These will be distributed over a period of several years.
The first drop already took place at the time of writing and the second is announced to start 2.12.2021. It will last for 3 days and will also be in the form of a Bid to Earn Auction.

Within Q4 2021 we should see approximately 60K parcels distributed, mostly within the Citaadel itself. 
A detailed timeline of REALM distribution can be found in the litepaper (see the useful links below). 


#### Tokenomics and gameplay 
According to the Gotchiverse lore, the parcels can be farmed to produce natural resources known as **Gotchus Alchemica** - ERC-20 tokens of varying rarity. 
There are 4 types of Alchemica (FOMO, FUD, ALPHA & KEK; KEK being the rarest - if you find something that makes you KEK, hold on to it ... ), which can be harvested and used to build installations and upgrade the Parcels. 

This is an overarching goal of the Gotchiverse - to collect Alchemica in order to bolster your parcel to produce more yield, and build defensive installations **in preparation for the Prophecy.**
What is the Prophecy, you ask? You'll need to read the litepaper to find out... 

Owning a Gotchi is not a prerequisite to owning REALM Parcels. There will be an option to rent out your Parcels for other Gotchis to farm. 
**Rentals** are not part of the marketplace at the moment, but **are planned as part of the Gotchiverse**. 
Currently, a similar concept is used to allow 3rd parties to interact with the player's Gotchi without having to transfer ownership.

As an **entry level (possibly F2P) option**, there will be assets known as **Lickqudators**. 
These are characters roaming the Gotchiverse, collecting loose Alchemica and engaging in combat with Aavegotchis and Parcel installations.

BTW, all visual assets are on-chain, which is very cool :) 



## The author's subjective take on this metaverse
Bullish AF

### How important is it to integrate
Aavegotchi is a solid project built with great attention to quality, innovation and detail. There is a feeling of under-promising and over-delivering all the while having a very ambitious long-term roadmap. 

The team has been actively working on enhancing the player's overall user experience, learning from issues and listening to feedback. 
Also, they have been onboarding top tier talent in preparation for the Gotchiverse launch, most notably David Fried (ex-Blizzard game designer) and Mauvis Ledford (ex-Coinmarketcap CTO).

This project would definitely be a great addition to the portfolio. 

### How hard would it be to integrate 
Minigames, dapps and tools built by the community are a nice testament to the openness (technological and cultural) and low-friction development. 
The team itself encourages and supports the community in building Aavegotchi based stuff. This is IMHO a good foundation for any integration activities. 

Also, the possibility of 3rd parties interacting with assets is already partially implemented in Aavegotchi and the team itself has plans for allowing rentals of Land as well as Gotchis.  

The collaboration itself might need to be voted on by the DAO, so there's an aspect of promoting the benefits, attending AMAs and having a clear win-win proposal.

# Actionable Items (Core Team input)

The Gotchiverse report is very promising. The implementation of the REALM contracts are Diamond patterns so they are 
upgradeable. We already reached out the Gotchi fam to discuss options for collaboration since based on their roadmap,
they are planning to provide renting/lending marketplace in the protocol. Since we already have that code ready and 
audited we have a win-win situation which we will try to capture.
